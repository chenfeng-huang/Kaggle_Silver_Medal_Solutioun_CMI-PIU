## Child Mind Institute â€” Problematic Internet Use (CMIâ€‘PIU) Solution
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10+-blue.svg)



This solution was developed for the Kaggle competition [Child Mind Institute â€” Problematic Internet Use](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use), where participants predict the severity category `sii âˆˆ {0,1,2,3}` using demographics, clinical/questionnaire data, and wearable timeâ€‘series signals. The approach combines tabular features with perâ€‘participant timeâ€‘series summary statistics and trains treeâ€‘based regressors with outâ€‘ofâ€‘fold validation and threshold optimization for the Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) metric.

Our work earned a Silver Medal. The repository contains an endâ€‘toâ€‘end notebook that reproduces training and inference and generates a valid `submission.csv`. ðŸ¥ˆ

## Competition Overview

### Competition Introduction

The task is to build a predictive model for `sii` (four ordered categories) using a mixture of tabular data (demographics, physical health, and questionnaires such as SDS/PCIAT) and multivariate timeâ€‘series recorded per participant. The evaluation metric is **Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK)**, which measures agreement between predicted classes and ground truth while penalizing larger class discrepancies more heavily.

### Competition Background

Problematic Internet Use is an emerging mentalâ€‘health concern. The dataset couples questionnaire and clinical information with wearable timeâ€‘series, enabling models that can leverage both static and dynamic signals. A practical solution must align columns across train/test, summarize long timeâ€‘series efficiently, and handle missing/categorical features robustly while optimizing directly for the orderedâ€‘class QWK objective.

## Solution Overview

This solution comprises three components:

1. **Timeâ€‘Series Feature Extraction**: Aggregate each participantâ€™s parquet timeâ€‘series into compact summary statistics via `DataFrame.describe()` (e.g., count, mean, std, quantiles, max) per channel.
2. **Tabular Fusion and Preprocessing**: Merge timeâ€‘series stats with tabular features by `id`, fill and encode seasonâ€‘type categoricals, and align train/test columns.
3. **Modeling and Thresholding**: Train treeâ€‘based regressors with 5â€‘fold stratified CV on `sii`, ensemble predictions where helpful, and optimize three thresholds to discretize continuous predictions into {0,1,2,3} maximizing QWK.

The final output is a twoâ€‘column `submission.csv` with `id,sii`.

## Detailed Solution

### 1. Data Preprocessing

#### Data Reading and Transformation

- Read tabular files: `dataset/train.csv`, `dataset/test.csv`, and `dataset/sample_submission.csv`.
- Load perâ€‘participant timeâ€‘series from `dataset/series_train.parquet/` and `dataset/series_test.parquet/`, where each participant has `id=<participant_id>/part-0.parquet`.
- Drop the `step` column from timeâ€‘series and compute `describe()` for each channel; flatten into features `stat_0 .. stat_N`.
- Merge the resulting stats DataFrame to the tabular frames on `id`, then drop `id` after merging.

#### Categorical Handling and Missing Values

- Identify seasonâ€‘type categorical columns (e.g., `Basic_Demos-Enroll_Season`, `CGAS-Season`, `Physical-Season`, `PAQ_*`, `SDS-Season`, `PreInt_EduHx-Season`).
- Fill missing categorical values with `"Missing"` and encode them into integers consistently across train/test.
- Keep numeric columns as is; imputation strategies can be applied if needed (the notebook includes utilities/libs for imputation and pipelines).

### 2. Modeling

#### Model Selection

- Use strong treeâ€‘based regressors in regression mode:
  - `LightGBM` (`LGBMRegressor`)
  - `XGBoost` (`XGBRegressor`)
  - `CatBoost` (`CatBoostRegressor`)
- Optionally combine them via a simple ensemble such as `VotingRegressor`.

#### Crossâ€‘Validation and OOF Predictions

- `StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)` on target `sii` to maintain class balance.
- Train on folds and collect outâ€‘ofâ€‘fold (OOF) predictions for validation analysis.

#### Threshold Optimization and Metric

- Optimize three thresholds on OOF predictions to map continuous outputs to {0,1,2,3} maximizing **QWK**:
  - Define a `threshold_Rounder` that applies thresholding.
  - Use `scipy.optimize.minimize` to search thresholds that maximize QWK (equivalently minimize negative QWK).
- Apply the optimized thresholds to test predictions to produce discrete `sii`.

### 3. Inference and Submission

- Fit models on each fold, average test predictions across folds.
- Apply optimized thresholds to the averaged predictions.
- Save the final `submission.csv` with columns `id,sii` in the repo root.

## How to Reproduce

### Environment Setup

- Python 3.10+ recommended
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `lightgbm`, `xgboost`, `catboost`, `scipy`, `pyarrow`, `tqdm`.

### Data Layout

Place the competition data under `dataset/`:

```
dataset/
â”œâ”€ train.csv
â”œâ”€ test.csv
â”œâ”€ sample_submission.csv
â”œâ”€ series_train.parquet/
â”‚  â””â”€ id=<participant_id>/part-0.parquet
â””â”€ series_test.parquet/
   â””â”€ id=<participant_id>/part-0.parquet
```
